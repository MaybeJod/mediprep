# MediPrep: Enhancing Hospital Visits with VR & AR Overview

This project explores integrating Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) into MediPrep, a service helping children prepare for hospital visits. Founded by anesthesiologist Gunilla Lööf, MediPrep aims to reduce the common fear and anxiety children experience before medical procedures.

## The Challenge

Over 60% of children experience significant fear before hospital visits, leading to pain, stress, and long-term anxiety. Current methods often fall short in adequately preparing them.

## Our Solution

We've developed VR and AR prototypes to deliver interactive, educational experiences. Based on research showing the effectiveness of digital learning, these solutions aim to reduce negative emotions by better preparing children and their families for medical encounters.
